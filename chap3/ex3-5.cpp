// Exercise 3-5

/*
    Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The program
    could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names, and the second the
    final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you should assume a fixed
    number of homework grades. We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable number of
    grades intermixed with student names.
